  storyText: "Living all doubts behind, Potato found the path and returned on it
    one again. Soon the trail led him to a small glade with gigantic strange things
    of unnatural colours (tents). Definetly, Potato smelled aliens, but the glade
    was empty. Maybe they left. Among smells of aliens, kiwi noticed a precious smell
    of food. Worms! Looks like the smell came from the small cylindrical (how does
    kiwi know what means \"cylindrical\"? Anyway!) thing which was opened. \n\n1.
    Carefully approach to cylindrical thing, grab worms, .... ,PROFIT!... Now RUN!
    (kiwi grabs worms and run back in bushes)\n\nAuthor decided that wild life and
    hoomans won't cross in this game. Let the nature be untouched this time.  "
