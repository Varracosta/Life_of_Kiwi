  storyText: "As curious as ordinary kiwi can be, Potato decided to follow the intriguing
    trail of alien foorsteps. \nIn 15 minutes or so, the trail led him to strange
    object. He never saw anything like that, it was bold and brown, smelled like
    a leather, and had two long lases similar to roots or eels who he knew occupied
    the rivers. A fear doubled in him, but curiosity became stronger.\n\n1. \"It's
    better to return to food search. It becomes stranger and stranger\"\n2. Follow
    the trail of footsteps\n\n \n"
