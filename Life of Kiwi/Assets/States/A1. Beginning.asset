  storyText: "Once upon a time, in rainforests of New Zealand lived a kiwi. His name
    was Potato, which means \"skitish and round\". \r\nPotato had lots of friends.
    He loved to roam in the forest and foraging. \r\nOne day he met something very
    strange. It was a trail of enourmous footprints, each was the same size of Potato
    himself. \r\nThe trail led somewhere. \r\n\r\nHe could go on the trail or continue
    to search for worms.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do?\r\n1. Investigate where the trail
    leads\r\n2. \"Nah, I still have to search for food\r because I don't have a Countdown
    here\""
