  storyText: "Potato tries to prove that his name is not a synonym to \"coward\",
    and he decides to encounter the murderous beast! Possum rushed forward, but Potato
    dodged, and hit it with all strengh of kiwi mighty muscle legs! His sharp claws
    slashed over possum's muzzle. The beast squilled in pain, and rushed in bush,
    running away from Potato. \nNow and forever the forests of New Zealand (well,
    honestly, only this small part where Potato lives) will know him as a brave hero!
    And now \"Potato\" will mean \"round and audacious\".\n\nPotato noticed that
    a handsome, beautiful kiwi girl watched  how he fought. She is impressed, if
    not the least! \n\n1. Forget about adventures and try to build a family\n2. \"A
    true warrior stays on the path\" (try to find the trail) "
