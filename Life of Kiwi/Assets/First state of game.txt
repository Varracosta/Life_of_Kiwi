Once upon a time, in rainforests of New Zealand lived a kiwi. His name was Potato, which means "skitish and round". 
Potato had lots of friends. He loved to roam in the forest and foraging. 
One day he met something very strange. It was a trail of enourmous footprints, each was the same size of Potato himself. 
The trail led somewhere. 

He could go on the trail or continue to search for worms.

What should he do?
1. Investigate where the trail leads
2. "Nah, I still have to search for food
 because I don't have a Countdown here"
